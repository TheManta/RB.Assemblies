**RB.Assemblies** is a NuGet package release of key [Reborn Buddy][5] assemblies, stripped of their code to function only as reference assemblies.  This simplifies third party development and automated builds by allowing the use of package managers instead of committing complete (and probably outdated) assemblies directly to repo.

These assemblies have been stripped of their code, leaving only the API behind -- **they cannot be executed**.  This project is only for third party developer convenience, not end users.  Please support the official release on the [Reborn Buddy][5] website.
